      He was a workaholic. He never chose his family or friends over his work. 
       
      He always thought, "Later, after I end this call".
      Or "Later, after I finish this project".
      Or "Later, after I get this promotion".

       Yes, even his own mother. They grew up poor, but at least they had each other.
       She gave up everything so he could go to his top choice college,
       University of Catlinoleum, Cata Cruz.
       But one he got there, he never called home, not even on Meowther's Day.
       He always said he was too busy.

        Yest, even his girlfriend. They met their senior years of college, April 10th.
        He fell madly in love, but never took the time to show it.
        In the threee years they dated, he never remembered one of their anniversaries.
        She left, but he barely noticed.

       Yes, even his best friend. They grew up together and were closer than two peas in a pod.
       Fanncy felt he had to do anything he could to live up to his name,
       but his friend just wanted to enjoy life. 
       Once Fancy moved away, he never contacted his friend again.

        He never had enough money or very many friends, but he always thought he had more than
        enough time. He realized too late that time was the only thing he couldn't get more of.

        Eventually, she stopped calling him. She moved on with her life, she found solace in
        her friends. She found a life outside of being a mother. She had to.

      He wanted her to be proud of him. He told himself that he would call when he had done enough

      He was diagnosed with cancer at 43. It was treatable, but he decided not to treat it,
      lest the treatments gobble all the wealth he had worked his whole life to get. After all,
      There was nothing left for him to live for. 
      
      In his final moments, no one came to comfort him.
