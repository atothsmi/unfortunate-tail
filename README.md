# Artist Statement

I started out with the idea that I wanted to make a project that was visually silly and textually sad/dark. I started by writing out my story on paper and using a numbering system to plan out the next scene I had to write in a sequence.

I settled on writing about a cat that does nothing in his life but work and then he dies, because people do this in real life, but when it’s about cats people automatically think it’s going to be silly. To highlight the visual silliness, I imported two fonts from Google Fonts, Gluten and Dongle. The soft, irregular curves of each of these fonts sends a happy message that completely contrasts from the text content. I drew all of the images in an online photo editor and heavily reused elements in order to make it seem even more storybook or kid-like. Here is my final diagram of my story.

I created one ending that was loosely only accessible if the player had gone through and remembered the other branches. Of course, the player could just guess their way to the ending, but it is easier to access that ending if the player has seen everything else.
